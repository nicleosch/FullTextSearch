# Full-Text Search

This repository is the result of a research project comparing different types of approaches for searching strings in a set of text documents.

The following approaches were implemented:

## Inverted Index

Maps each token in the documents to its appearances.

## Trigram Index

Maps each trigram in the documents to its appearances.

## Vector Index

Each document is represented as a vector, which is conceptualised as a point in a multi-dimensional space.
